# Object_Oriented_Programming
Welcome to Object_Oriented_Programming üìã This Repository was made to maintain various [LAB CONTENT](https://github.com/theabhishek07/Object_Oriented_Programming/tree/master/LAB_WORK) , [JAVA_PROGRAMS](https://github.com/theabhishek07/Object_Oriented_Programming/tree/master/JAVA_Programs) ,[ASSIGNMENTS](https://github.com/theabhishek07/Object_Oriented_Programming/tree/master/Assignments), [STUDY MATERIAL](https://github.com/theabhishek07/Object_Oriented_Programming/tree/master/STUDY_MATERIAL) and all the Object_Oriented_Programming related stuff so that they all can be compiled in a single space. This Repository is maintained by [theabhishek07](https://github.com/theabhishek07) .This is a public Repository and all sorts of contributions to the code are welcomed.

**_You are always welcome to add more or improve any resource in this repository._**

# Steps to follow üìú

## 1. Fork it üç¥
You can get your own fork/copy of [Object_Oriented_Programming](https://github.com/theabhishek07/Object_Oriented_Programming) by using the `Fork` button.

## 2. Clone it üë•
You need to go to your Fork of the Repository and then clone (download) it to local machine using

`$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/Object_Oriented_Programming.git`

This makes a local copy of repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the `Object_Oriented_Programming` repository in Github, move to that folder first using change directory command on linux and Mac.
```python
# This will change directory to a folder Object_Oriented_Programming                                                                   
$ cd Object_Oriented_Programming
```
Move to this folder for all other commands.

Now, lets add a reference to the original `Object_Oriented_Programming` repository using

`$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/theabhishek07/Object_Oriented_Programming.git` 

 This adds a new remote named **_upstream_**.

See the changes using
```pyhton
 $ git remote -v
 origin https://github.com/Your_Username/Object_Oriented_Programming.git (fetch)                                                      
 origin https://github.com/Your_Username/Object_Oriented_Programming.git (push)                                                        
 upstream https://github.com/theabhishek07/Object_Oriented_Programming.git (fetch)                                                     
 upstream https://github.com/theabhishek07/Object_Oriented_Programmingt.git (push)
 ```

## 3. Sync with the Remote üîÑ
Always keep your local copy of repository updated with the original repository.
```python
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune
# Switch to master branch
$ git checkout master
# Reset local master branch to match upstream repository's master branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/master
# Push changes to your forked Object_Oriented_Programming repo
$ git push origin master
```

## 4. Create a new branch ‚ÄºÔ∏è
Whenever you are going to make a contribution. Please create a new branch using the command below and keep your `master` branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).
```python
# It will create a new branch <branchname> with name and switch to branch <branchname>
$ git checkout -b <branchname>
```
 
 To switch to desired branch
```python
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git checkout <branchname>
```

To add the changes to the branch. Use
```python
# To add all files to branch
`$ git add .
```
Type in a message relevant for the code reveiwer using 
```python
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m "relevant message"
```

Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using
```python
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin <branchname>
```

Finally, go to your repository in browser and click on `compare and pull requests`. Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your precious effort.
